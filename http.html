    <h3 style="color: white">HTTP Protocol</h3>
    <h4 style="color: white">Definition</h4>
    <p style="color: white; margin-top: 1cm>">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for
        distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World
        Wide Web.HTTP was invented alongside HTML to create the first interactive, text-based web browser: the original
        World Wide Web. Today, the protocol remains one of the primary means of using the Internet.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4 style="color: white">Example</h4>
    <p style="color: white">As a request-response protocol, HTTP gives users a way to interact with web resources such
        as HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers. HTTP clients generally use
        Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections to communicate with servers.

        HTTP utilizes specific request methods in order to perform various tasks. All HTTP servers use the GET and HEAD
        methods, but not all support the rest of these request methods:<br>

        - GET requests a specific resource in its entirety<br>
        - HEAD requests a specific resource without the body content<br>
        - POST adds content, messages, or data to a new page under an existing web resource<br>
        - PUT directly modifies an existing web resource or creates a new URI if need be<br>
        - DELETE gets rid of a specified resource<br>
        - TRACE shows users any changes or additions made to a web resource<br>
        - OPTIONS shows users which HTTP methods are available for a specific URL<br>
        - CONNECT converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel<br>
        - PATCH partially modifies a web resource<br>
        - HTTP can be leveraged by cyber attackers using techniques like HTTP smuggling.</p>

    <h3 style="color: white">HTTPS Protocol</h3>
    <h4 style="color: white">Definition</h4>
    <p style="color: white">HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is the protocol where encrypted HTTP
        data is transferred over a secure connection. By using secure connection such as Transport Layer Security or
        Secure Sockets Layer, the privacy and integrity of data are maintained and authentication of websites is also
        validated.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4 style="color: white">Example</h4>
    <p style="color: white"> HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called
       Transport Layer Security (TLS),
       although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol secures communications by using
       what’s
       known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure. This type of security system uses two different keys to encrypt
       communications between two parties:

       The private key - this key is controlled by the owner of a website and it’s kept, as the reader may have
       speculated,
       private. This key lives on a web server and is used to decrypt information encrypted by the public key.
       The public key - this key is available to everyone who wants to interact with the server in a way that’s secure.
       Information that’s encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted by the private key.</p>
