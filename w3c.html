    <h3 style="color: white">W3C</h3>
    <h4 style="color: white">Definition</h4>
    <p style="color: white; margin-top: 1cm>">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where
        Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web
        inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full
        potential.

    <h3 style="color: white">HTML</h3>
    <h4 style="color: white">Definition</h4>
    <p style="color: white">Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
        displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4 style="color: white">Example</h4>
    <p style="color: white">HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The
        language, which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, as
        time goes on, increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the
        demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that
        designs and maintains the language; for instance, with the transition to Web 2.0.

        HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called hyperlinks,
        users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the
        Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they
        mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized
        type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.</p>

    <h3 style="color:white;">CSS</h3>
    <h4 style="color: white">Definition</h4>
    <p style="color: white">Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
        document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4 style="color: white">Example</h4>
    <p style="color: white">CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of
        the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what
        background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen
        sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

        CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
        Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.<br>

        Advantages of CSS<br>
        - CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style
        for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.<br>

        - Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write
        one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.<br>

        - Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will
        be updated automatically.<br>

        - Superior styles to HTML − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look
        to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.<br>

        - Multiple Device Compatibility − Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By
        using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs
        and cell phones or for printing.<br>

        - Global web standards − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a
        good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.</p>
